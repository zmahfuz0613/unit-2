# Unit 2: React!

In this unit, you'll learn about React which is a view library for building modern and dynamic web applications. We'll build off of the frontend fundamentals from unit one in order to make a single page application.

## Objectives

By the end of this unit, developers should be able to:

* Build dynamic single-page application in React
* Define components in a React app and work with both props and state
* Hook in to the component lifecycle to work with events and third-party libraries
* Use React Router to add routing to a React-based SPA
* Use AJAX to connect a React front-end to an API

## Unit Schedule

[Here]() is the link to this unit's calendar.

## Project 2

We'll give more details as we get closer to the project, but you will be building a React frontend that connects to an API for your project. The required technologies will be:

- React
- React Router
- Axios
